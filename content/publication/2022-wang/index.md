abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) DNA origami is widely used for applications ranging from excitonics to single-molecule biophysics. Conventional, single-layer 2D DNA origami exhibits flexibility and curvature in solution; however, that may limit its suitability as a 2D structural template. In contrast, 2D wireframe DNA origami rendered with six-helix bundle edges offers local control over duplex orientations with enhanced in-plane rigidity. Here, we investigate the 3D structure of these assemblies using cryo–electron microscopy (cryo-EM). 3D reconstructions reveal a high degree of planarity and homogeneity in solution for polygonal objects with and without internal mesh, enabling 10 Å resolution for a triangle. Coarse-grained simulations were in agreement with cryo-EM data, offering molecular structural insight into this class of 2D DNA origami. Our results suggest that these assemblies may be valuable for 2D material applications and geometries that require high structural fidelity together with local control over duplex orientations, rather than parallel duplex assembly.
