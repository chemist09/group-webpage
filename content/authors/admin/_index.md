Torsten John is Assistant Professor of Physical Chemistry at Constructor University in Bremen, where he leads a research group in Biophysical and Computational Chemistry. His work focuses on peptide self-assembly and interactions at interfaces, combining experimental and computational approaches to explore fundamental mechanisms and develop functional materials. He earned his PhD in chemistry with _summa cum laude_ from Leipzig University and conducted research at several international institutions including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Monash University, and the Max Planck Institute for Polymer Research. Torsten has been recognized with several awards and fellowships, including the Feodor Lynen Fellowship from the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, selection as a CAS/SciFinder Future Leader, and inclusion in IUPAC’s Periodic Table of Younger Chemists. He was also selected as a Young Scientist at the Lindau Nobel Laureate Meetings. As former Chair of the International Younger Chemists Network (IYCN), he remains committed to supporting the global early-career chemistry community.
