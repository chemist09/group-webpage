title: Mechanisms of Peptide Self-Assembly

We investigate the molecular mechanisms governing peptide self-assembly, with a particular focus on aggregation pathways, polymorphism, and β-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils. Using spectroscopy, surface-sensitive techniques, and molecular dynamics simulations, we study how peptide sequence, solvent conditions, and confinement influence nucleation, fibril growth, and higher-order organization. These studies are directly relevant to understanding aggregation processes associated with age-related and neurodegenerative diseases, while also providing a mechanistic foundation for the rational design of peptide-based materials.
