abstract: The European Young Chemists’ Network (EYCN) has been actively collaborating with the European Chemical Society (EuChemS) to create a platform for early-career scientists to contribute to policy-making in Europe. This article comments on the roles of chemists in policy-making and provides an overview of the initiatives and platforms for influencing at the European level from the perspective of early-career chemists, hoping to stimulate further engagement.
