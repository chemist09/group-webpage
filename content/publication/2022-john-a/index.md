abstract: Nanostructured surfaces are widespread in nature and are being further developed
  in materials science. This makes them highly relevant for biomolecules, such as
  peptides. In this data article, we present a curvature model and molecular dynamics
  (MD) simulation data on the influence of nanoparticle size on the stability of amyloid
  peptide fibrils related to our research article entitled “Mechanistic insights into
  the size-dependent effects of nanoparticles on inhibiting and accelerating amyloid
  fibril formation” (John et al., 2022) [1]. We provide the code to perform MD simulations
  in GROMACS 4.5.7 software of arbitrarily chosen biomolecule oligomers adsorbed on
  a curved surface of chosen nanoparticle size. We also provide the simulation parameters
  and data for peptide oligomers of Aβ<sub>40</sub>, NNFGAIL, GNNQQNY, and VQIYVK.
  The data provided allows researchers to further analyze our MD simulations and the
  curvature model allows for a better understanding of oligomeric structures on surfaces.
