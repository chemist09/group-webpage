title: Understanding Biomolecular Interactions at Interfaces
date: 2024-10-13
---

Interfaces, especially those that mimic biological membranes, are crucial to many systems we investigate. Our research explores how biomolecules, including peptides, interact with these interfaces and how these interactions influence processes such as antimicrobial activity and viral infection enhancement. Gaining insights into biomolecule-membrane interactions is vital for understanding biomolecular transport in cellular environments.
