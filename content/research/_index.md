### Research Vision
Our long-term goal is to establish predictive design principles that connect peptide sequence, environment, and interface chemistry to self-assembly pathways and biological function. By integrating biophysical experiments with molecular dynamics simulations, we aim to bridge fundamental mechanisms of peptide aggregation and membrane activity with disease-relevant insight and the rational design of functional biomolecular systems.

### Methods and Expertise
- Molecular dynamics simulations (atomistic and coarse-grained)
- Biophysical characterization of peptide self-assembly
- Spectroscopic and surface-sensitive techniques (e.g., QCM-D, fluorescence)
- Interface, nanoparticle, and membrane models
