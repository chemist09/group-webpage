title: Biomolecular Interactions at Interfaces

Interfaces play an active role in regulating biomolecular structure and function. Our research explores how peptides interact with biological and bio-inspired interfaces, including lipid membranes, nanoparticles, and soft matter surfaces. We examine how interfacial properties such as curvature, charge, and chemical functionality modulate peptide adsorption, self-assembly, and membrane activity. By elucidating interface-driven effects on peptide behavior, we aim to better understand processes such as antimicrobial activity, viral particle binding and concentration, and biomolecular transport in cellular environments.
